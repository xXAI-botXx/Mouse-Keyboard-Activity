# Mouse-Keyboard-Activity

With this project you can keep your process alive.

You choose which key/mouse-button should be pressed on which minute with what time limit and on which screen position. Also can activate a random walk of the mouse during the time to the next press-event.

**Press the Escape-Button ('esc') or the self-estimated key for quitting the program.**

> Hint: It is recommended to press the escape button 2 times not only ones. The program will stop after the first press but the os system can think that you still press the button, so just press it again and everything is fine.s
